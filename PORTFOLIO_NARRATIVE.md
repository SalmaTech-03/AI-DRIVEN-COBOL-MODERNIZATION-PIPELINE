# Candidate Portfolio: [Your Name]
**Target Role**: Data Scientist - Artificial Intelligence (IBM)

## Why this POC matters for IBM:
This project is a direct response to the **Legacy Modernization** challenges IBM solves every day. I have built a system that doesn't just "write code," but understands **Enterprise Risk and Architecture.**

### Demonstrated Mastery:
1.  **AI Frameworks**: TensorFlow and Keras used for predictive risk modeling.
2.  **GenAI**: Specialized prompt engineering for IBM DB2 SQL and Java refactoring.
3.  **Big Data**: PySpark implementation for distributed processing of code repositories.
4.  **Analytics**: Pandas-driven EDA and Matplotlib dashboards for business intelligence.
5.  **Cloud Native**: FastAPI and Docker integration ready for IBM Cloud/OpenShift.

### Professional Standards:
Every module is unit-tested, documented for both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and designed to scale.
